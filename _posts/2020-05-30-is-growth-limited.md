Short answer? Yes.<br>
But the long answer is No!<br>
How Come? Let's see.<br>
In 1958 when the whole world was in the race of supersonic transport, Boeing built **Boeing 707** with the max flying speed of *608 mph* and guess what is the max speed of the latest Boeing's latest Flagship in that domain?
Any Ideas?<br>
It is *593 mph* for **Boeing 787**, shocking right? But it’s entirely true.  
One thing that you need to understand is that according to various deep studies a.k.a. researches, this world follows an S-curve.

This s-curve denotes that growth is achieved first in an exponential way but then stays horizontal until eternity and then eventually might decrease as well. This is proven by multiple studies over time.
But then, how the answer is NO?  
The secret is, though the growth stagnates for the outer world, the efficiency of achieving that growth rate might shoot up exponentially in return over time.  
**Let us understand this by the same example we discussed above:**  
Though, since 1958 till 2020, Boeing is not able to dramatically improve the max speed and we’re in sort of a plateau stage of that curve since then, but, if we see the numbers, the fuel efficiency per traveller miler has dramatically increased by over 70%! That’s insane! Isn't it?  
Don’t worry, I have simplified the stats in the following graph to get a hold of it easily.

The same goes for cars made by classic old motor houses such as Ford, Chevrolet, etc.  
An author of a New York best-seller, [Growth](https://www.amazon.in/Growth-Microorganisms-Megacities-MIT-Press/dp/0262042835/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=growth+book&qid=1590860052&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=amazonx0b-21&linkId=30c987e796a68f6464d047748a72deca&language=en_IN), the Czech-Canadian professor Vaclav Smil, approaches things from a scientist’s point of view, not an astronaut’s, but he reaches the same conclusion:
> “Earth is fragile and before it is too late, we should embark in earnest on the most fundamental existential [task] of making any future growth compatible with the long-term preservation of the only biosphere we have.”

He beautifully explains how growth is limited and what we, as humans can do about it.
