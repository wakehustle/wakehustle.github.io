Indian multiplex operators were doing roaring business until the coronavirus pandemic forced them to shutter theaters in March, when a strict nationwide lockdown was announced. This week, India moved to restart its economy, allowing offices, malls, hotels, restaurants and places of worship to reopen. But theaters, which have already started reopening in the U.S, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Dubai, are likely to remain closed for at least another month if not longer in this nation of movie addicts.

Multiplex operators, such as PVR and Inox Leisure, which took a big hit in the last quarter ending March, therefore face an even bleaker outlook for the April to June quarter, which analysts have predicted will be a total washout.

Market leader PVR, which has 845 screens across 71 cities, had added 87 screens in the past fiscal year alone as it welcomed more than 100 million moviegoers. But for the quarter ended March 2020, the Delhi-headquartered company reported a loss of Rs. 480 million ($6 million) following a 27 % drop in revenue. 

PVR announced salary cuts and layoffs, while it simultaneously invoked the force majeure clause for non-payment of rents and sought moratoriums on loan repayments. The company is now looking to raise “confidence capital” of Rs. 3,000 million ($40 million) via an upcoming rights issue.

Mumbai-based Inox Leisure, a unit of the $1.7 billion (revenue) Inox Group, controlled by Devendra Jain, who features among India’s richest people, also saw revenue fall by more than a fifth in the quarter ended March, when it reported a loss of Rs. 20 million.

The company has deferred capital expenditure planned for this fiscal year though it noted in a stock exchange disclosure this week that it “has sufficient liquidity to fund the business operations for at least the next 6 months.” Inox has also negotiated for non-payment of rent and common area maintenance charges during the lockdown period and is looking to secure rent reductions once theaters reopen. 

By far, the biggest challenge theater owners face is luring back moviegoers, who have been binge-watching the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime video during the lockdown. 

“We are extremely confident that the business will come back stronger once the health concern due to the spread of Covid-19 gets controlled, and we are looking forward to welcoming back our patrons to the PVR experience,” Ajay Bijli, PVR’s chairman and managing director, said in a statement this week.

PVR has announced a range of re-opening protocols that it will follow: staggered seating with empty seats between different family or friends’ groups; fiber glass sheets at the box office and food outlets; sensor-based taps in washrooms and sanitizer dispensers with foot pedals.

To underscore the safety measures it is putting in place, Inox Leisure is looking to sign up Bollywood stars to endorse that it is safe to visit cinema halls again. It will also offer such carrots as a 25% discount on movie tickets, free popcorn and even private screenings for families.

Besides it has a pipeline of potential blockbuster releases such as Bollywood star Salman Khan’s action movie Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai and cop flick Sooryavanshi, starring Akshay Kumar, the only Indian to feature in Forbes 2020 list of the world’s highest paid celebrities.

But all these measures may still fall short in wooing audiences back, says Komal Nahta, editor of Mumbai trade publication Film Information. “The public’s confidence has to be won. The fear factor has to be overcome...theaters will be the last thing on their priority list.”

As they deal with non-existent revenues, multiplex operators now have to defend their turf against OTT (over-the-top media services offered via the internet) operators such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Disney-Hotstar. Given the uncertainty over theater re-openings, producers with fully completed or nearly completed films are going straight to streaming. Gulabo Sitabo, a family comedy with Bollywood veteran Amitabh Bachchan released on Prime Video today and more such digital-first releases are on the way.

But multiplex operators are hoping that the magic of the big screen will continue to hold sway. As per a recent survey by Mumbai media consulting firm Ormax Media, 82% of the respondents said they missed going to theaters, but nearly half said they will wait two to three weeks after theaters reopen to decide if they want to go back.

“This is a chicken and egg situation,” says Urmil Shah, research analyst at Mumbai investment firm IDBI Capital. “Even if I am a movie freak, I wouldn’t want to take a risk unless the content is really good. And if I am a producer, I won’t release my film until there are meaningful footfalls in cinema halls.”
